# My weekly routine

On Monday I usually have a lot of meetings. I don't like meetings and I'm
always tired after them, but sometimes they can be interesting.

On Tuesday I check my bills and bank accounts. Sometimes I have meetings with my
accountant after that.

On Wednesday I do my regular work tasks. In the evening I usually do fitness excercises.

On Thursday I check my work data and audit the backup copies. It's an important
task but it's really boring, despite the process is mostly automated.

On Friday I finish my work tasks and schedule new ones for the next week.

On Saturday I spend time with my family. We go for a walk, play sports. In the
evening we go to a restaurant.

On Sunday I rest at home and sleep. At noon I go shopping.
