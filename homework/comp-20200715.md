# my lunch break

I usually start my lunch break at 3pm. I eat a couple of sandwiches, surf the
Internet and text my friends.

I sometimes go for a walk, depends on the weather. If the weather is fine, I
often finish my day working outdoors.

I never play computer games. But I occasionally play games on my smartphone.

If the weather is unpleasant, I often get some exercise in my work room. I
have got the training equipment there.

On Friday I sometimes finish my work earlier, leave office and have lunch in
a restaurant or a cafe.
