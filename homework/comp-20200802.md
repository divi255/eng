Hello, I'm Sergei. I come from the Czech Republic and I live in Prague, the
capital city. That's the largest city in CZ and it's the only city which has
got a subway and population above 1 million.

It has got a lot of castles in and nearby. There're also a lot of other
sightseeing places, including the famous Charle's Bridge and 700-years old
Charles University.

There're also a lot of museums and restaurants. People are friendly in CZ,
especially in the capital city, but beware of pickpocketers and unfair currency
exchanges! (We still have own currency - Czech koruna, people like it and I
guess we'll never switch to euro).

There's always a lot of tourists in Prague. The local authority says the
numbers are smaller this year, due to coronavirus, but I see the Prague city
centre is still crowded with foreigners and there're usual traffic jams.
