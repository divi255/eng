## The perfect city

Here's my opinion about the perfect city.

Personally, I don't suggest to build the city directly on the sea coast. I've
lived in lots of such cities and I found them too molded. It's nice to have the
sea nearby, but it should be far enough.

The perfect city should definitely have large highways to have good logistics.
But they shouldn't be too close to residential areas to prevent the noise.
However, because modern residential areas are quite large, roads nearby should
be wide enough to prevent traffic jams in rush hours.

There should be many parks and unspoilt natural places. The city could become
wider, but the green zones give people relax and health.

I'd like to suggest the government to avoid concentrating everything in a
single or a couple of big cities. In my opinion, the most comfortable city has
the population around a million people.
